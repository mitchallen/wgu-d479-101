            <h2>Getting Around</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Language</h3>
                <p>
                    Many younger Tanitians speak fluent English. Very little English is spoken in rural areas, 
                    especially by the older residents. If you are lost in the city, just ask anyone for directions
                    and they will be more than happy to help you.
                </p>

                <h3>Ground</h3>
                <p>
                    Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. 
                    <br /><br />
                    For $5 USD you can buy a bus pass from the driver and ride the bus all day.
                    <br /><br />
                    Private buses serve the rest of the 
                    island. 
                    <br /><br />
                    Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a local rental agency near the 
                    airport. 
                    <br /><br />
                    Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by law). 
                    <br /><br />
                    Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing: 
                    this area is easy to explore on foot.

                <p>
                    Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air. Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate 
                    small jets and propeller planes. Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will
                    be able to land on the island within the next few years.
